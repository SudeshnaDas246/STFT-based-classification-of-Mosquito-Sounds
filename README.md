# STFT-based-classification-of-Mosquito-Sounds
The purpose of this project is to analyse the audio signal produced by different mosquito species and classify the audio signals on the basis of different features extracted.
The proposed algorithm detects the frequency bands at which the magnitude of the audio signal forms peaks and provides information about the magnitude peaks, i.e., the local maxima and the full width at half maximum. These calculated metrics is to be used for the mosquito species classification.
